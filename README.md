A motivated and enthusiastic Cloud and DevOps Engineer based in Bengaluru, Karnataka. I specialize in building and managing scalable, resilient cloud infrastructure using modern DevOps practices. My passion lies in automating everything from code integration to deployment to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

👨‍💻 About Me
I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications and hands-on training in cloud technologies. I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and am always eager to learn and implement the latest trends in the cloud-native landscape.

☁️ I'm passionate about Cloud Computing and automating infrastructure on AWS.

🚀 I enjoy designing and optimizing CI/CD pipelines to streamline development workflows.

🐳 I have hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes for containerizing and orchestrating applications.

📝 I use Terraform to manage infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.

🌱 I’m currently looking for opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and grow as a DevOps professional.
